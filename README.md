# DIGITAL-CALCULATOR-CODE-USING-C

      C programming influences many other programming languages. Most
of the programming languages popular today are either direct descendants
of C or heavenly influenced by C. Hence, C Programming is a great first step
if you are a new programmer.
 #Program weakness :-
        We know that no any problem can be 100% reliable and efficient, so
there are also some drawback from my system which are as follows:-
        o User cannot perform all the required function or operation as a
professional one it is simply a calculator, it is not a graphical user
interface there are just some of test colours and borders.
        o It is not a multipurpose and can't perform various tasks at a single
time.
  #Program strength :-
        o It is actually a user-friendly software use by just following instruction
which are appear on the screen.
        o Once an operation performed will be deleted if there is no chance to
recall any of the operation.
